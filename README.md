# Comparison-of-Different-Vehicle-Models
The purpose of this work is to make a comparison of Double Track, Single Track and Linear Single Track Model.
First of all the Double Track Model is defined, then the Single Track model is defined starting from the Double Track, and finally the Linear Single Track Model is obtained simply by linearizing the **axle charactheristic** of the Single Track.

The project contains more files:
- Equations.nb is the Mathematica Notebook that contains all the equations used to describe the dynamics of the car;
- Main.nb is the Mathematica Notebook that contains the simulations of all models;
- In the folder Car_Parameters there are the parameters of the car (in .json format).

To run the project is enough to evaluate the file Main.nb, after that will appear a choose dialog with which you can choose the parameters of the car in the folder Car_Parameters.
